# CART 315 Prototype 3
 
 In this prototype my goal was to create an engaging and immersive experience for the player. The objective is fairly simple (get to the safe house before the "enemies" get to you), and in order to do so, players have to navigate their way through a terrain that I have constructed as a forest.
