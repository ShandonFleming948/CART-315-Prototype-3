# CART 315 Prototype 3
 
 In this prototype my goal was to create an engaging and immersive experience for the player. The objective is fairly simple (get to the safe house before the "enemies" get to you), and in order to do so, players have to navigate their way through a terrain that I have constructed as a forest.
 
 March 25th Reflections:
 The crux of what I intended on functioning was able to function (the enemies chased the player), but there are a few things to improve. I definitely need to get the terrain texture to work, and I need to include a sky box and adjust the lighting. I also need to adjust the player's sprint speed and set up game endings such as a "game over" if you get caught and a "you won" if you make it to safety.
