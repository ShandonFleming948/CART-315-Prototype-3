# CART 315 Prototype 3/Final Iteration
 
 In this prototype my goal was to create an engaging and immersive experience for the player. The objective is fairly simple (get to the safe house before the "enemies" get to you), and in order to do so, players have to navigate their way through a terrain that I have constructed as a forest.
 
 March 25th Reflections:
 The crux of what I intended on functioning was able to function (the enemies chased the player), but there are a few things to improve. I definitely need to get the terrain texture to work, and I need to include a sky box and adjust the lighting. I also need to adjust the player's sprint speed and set up game endings such as a "game over" if you get caught and a "you won" if you make it to safety.

April 8th Final Reflections:
For my final iteration, I added A LOT of finishing touches to the scene of the game. I adjusted the lighting to that of a moonlight night, and I added a wide array of plant life such as shrubs, ferns, bioluminescent mushrooms, and an interactive grass that grows as you walk on it. I also made sure that I added audio for both the "alien jungle environment" as well as the alien creatures that chase the player character. For the alien creatures, I implemented 3D spatial audio which allows them to get louder the closer they get to the player's character which helped to add more depth to the game. As a result, the environment is much more immersive, and considering that I did not know how to create a simple gameObject three months ago, I am very pleased with what I was able to create.
